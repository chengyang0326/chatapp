# Chatapp
This is a Python-based Chat room. The project is based on the Socket Progamming; done using Python. The app also contain some simple gui which implement by using tkinter library in python. A server is set to the listening mode, with a specific IP Address and Port numner (that can be edited in the script) and clients are made to connect to the server, after which they are promopted to enter a nickname. The messages are then broadcasted to all the clients present.

# Introduction
Sockets and the socket API are used to send messages across a network. They provide a form of inter-process communication (IPC). The network can be a logical, local network to the computer, or one thatâ€™s physically connected to an external network, with its own connections to other networks. The obvious example is the Internet, which you connect to via your ISP.
# Useage
We will have to start our Server first.
```
Python server.py
```
